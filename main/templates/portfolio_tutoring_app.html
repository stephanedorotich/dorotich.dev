<p>
    I've been a private Math, Physics, and Chemistry tutor for nearly a decade. When I started
    getting comfortable with Python in 2019 I developed a CLI application for my business.

<p>
    My program tracks Students, Sessions, and Invoices. I use it in Ubuntu (WSL2) and have used
    it consistently since 2019. Its raison d'Ãªtre is to generate PDF invoices each month; a time-consuming
    task.

    At the time, I had been recently exposed to LaTeX. This lead me to use python string literals
    to write an entire LaTeX invoice which I used to generate invoices.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years I fixed a various issues and added new features. In 2022, I performed a major 
    system upgrade. My program now uses Pandas dataframes for data storage and manipulation and
    Pandoc, Markdown, and Yaml for generating the PDFs in a less verbose and more structured manner.
